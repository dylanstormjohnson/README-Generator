## Description

- This project was made using Javascript and Node.js.  I was motivated to build this project because I wanted to practice with node.js and its ability to utilize the file system on my computer.  It was built because I wanted to speed up the process of creating a README file for projects I have worked on.  It is intended to solve the problem of the extended amount of time it takes to create a README.  In making said project, I learned a basic understanding of markdown, template literals, npms, inquirer, and async functions.
