## Description

- This project was made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, JQuery, Node.js, MySQL.  I was motivated to build this project To learn more about node.js  It was built because I wanted to simplify making README's for my projects.  It is intended to solve the problem of constantly recreating the same markdown code for README's  In making said project, I learned more about node.js, markdown formatting, and command line applications.
