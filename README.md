    ## Description
    
    - This project was made using Javascript and Node.js.  I was motivated to build this project because I wanted to practice with node.js and its ability to utilize the file system on my computer.  It was built because I wanted to speed up the process of creating a README file for projects I have worked on.  It is intended to solve the problem of the extended amount of time it takes to create a README.  In making said project, I learned a basic understanding of markdown, template literals, npms, inquirer, and async functions.

    ## Features

    -Upon opening, the user is presented with a series of questions about the project the README is being made for.

    -The questions are topical, involving the making, languages, usage, features, credits, and more of the project at hand.

    -The questions are worded simply and invite short, quick answers which can be fleshed out later within the README that is made.

    -An image name and file type as well as a GitHub Repository URL are prompted to further provide context within the README.

    -The final product is a well put together README.md file capable of fulfilling the role of the project's README with minor editing.
