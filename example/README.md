## Description

- This project was made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, JQuery, Node.js, MySQL.  I was motivated to build this project because it interested me.  It was built because I wanted to build a README generator easily for my following challanges.  It is intended to solve the problem of constantly retyping my readme formatting  In making said project, I learned more about formatting in markdown and command line applications
